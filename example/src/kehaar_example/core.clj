;;; pure, but it isn't in this case (so it can demonstrate sending
;;; separate messages on topic exchanges). The function only deals
;;; with numbers though, not messages or parsing or queues.

;;; First we set up the core.async channels we need.

;;; These channels are for the Fibonacci service. One channel for
;;; incoming requests, and the other for sending responses back. These
;;; two channels will be passed to `wire-up/incoming-service` and
;;; `wire-up/start-responder!` to set the service in motion.

;;; the argument for `fib` and returns a core.async channel to listen
